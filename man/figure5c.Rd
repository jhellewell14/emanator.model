\description{
This performs a unknown amount of model runs. It systematically searches for the maximum pre-intervention EIR that ITN and ITN+emanator
combinations will eliminate for varying levels of bioassay survival in the local gambiae-like vector population. This plot is for optimal emanators with 100% repellency and no decay in effect over time.
